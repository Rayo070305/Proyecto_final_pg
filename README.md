# Introduction

The solar system simulator is an interactive educational application developed in Python using the OpenGL and Pygame libraries. This application features a menu of options where users can choose between navigating a solar system simulation and accessing a section with detailed information about each planet. In the solar system simulation, users can move around the entire scene by controlling the camera with the keyboard and mouse.

# Movement

- "W": go forward .
- "A": move to the left.
- "S": go backwards.
- "D": move to the right.

# How we did it

The 3D solar system simulation project uses Pygame and OpenGL and has several important functionalities. Pygame is started and a viewport with OpenGL support is configured, allowing for the implementation of textures.

The Camera Class allows you to control the user's perspective by capturing keyboard and mouse input to move and orient the camera within the boundaries of the skybox. It is possible to upload textures for the moon, planets, Saturn's rings, and the skybox, as well as an OBJ model of a satellite with its textures.

The main axis of the program manages user events, updates the camera, and represents the skybox, the sun, the planets with their orbits and rings, and the satellite in motion. The planets orbit the sun at different speeds, producing a constant, dynamic animation, while the satellite has its own animated orbit.

Additionally, background music is played using pygame.mixer, improving user immersion. Together, these elements integrate to offer an interactive and visually engaging experience of a 3D solar system.
